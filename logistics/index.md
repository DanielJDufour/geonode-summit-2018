### Conference Fee

There is no conference fee.  GeoNode Summit 2016 is completely free.  However, we are looking for sponsors for secondary items, such as after hours events, etc.

### Dress Code

Dress code is **business casual** as conference location is a work site.  For example, jeans, khaki, skirts, etc. are okay.  No flip flops, etc.  Use your best judgement.

### Accomodations

We have a block of **25 rooms** at Worldhotel Ripa Roma in Trastevere for **€ 99** per night.  The hotel is within walking distance from **ROMA TRASTEVERE**, a train station connecting to WFP and is on the **#8** and **#3** tram lines.  You can conveniently take the **#8** tram directly into the city center.  The address is:

```
Worldhotel Ripa Roma
Via degli Orti di Trastevere, 3
00153 Roma
http://www.worldhotelriparoma.com/
```

For our block, we have a special rate of **€ 99 per night**.  Rate includes American Buffet Breakfast, Vat and Service – city tax 6 Euro per person per day excluded. Unlimited WiFi is also included.  The deadline to book under this block is **extended to November 16, 2016**.  If the reservation is cancelled after **November 16**, then you are charged a cancellation fee equal to **2 nights**.  If you cancel before November 16, there is no cancellation fee.  Please use the following block code when booking: **"GeoNode Summit 2016/DuFour"**.  Be sure to include **"/DuFour"**.  The easiest way to book is to follow this booking link on **yourreservation.net**.

If you have any issue with the website, you can also call or email the following (be sure to reference the provided block code).

```

Book directly with the hotel, using the **room block name/booking code**, rather than using hotels.com, booking.com, etc. for the same hotel.  For the first days of the Summit, we'll meet in the lobby before walking to the train station.  Finding an affordable hotel closer to the city center and with a simpler commute will be difficult.

**By Flying**

If flying into Rome, The easiest way to get to the hotel is to take the **Regional** train from Fiumicino Airport (FCO) to **ROMA TRASTEVERE** station.  Do not take the **LEONARDO EXPRESS** as that train does not stop at **ROMA TRASTEVERE**.  The train ride takes approximately **26 minutes**.  The hotel is a short 15 minute walk from the train station.  However, you can take the **#3** or **#8** tram for 3 stops to get within 1 block from the hotel.  You can buy your train tickets at the station or online.

**By Train**

If taking the train into Rome, you can take **Trenitalia** or **Italo** to **ROMA TERMINI** station.  If your train only goes to **ROMA TERMINI**, then you can transfer at **ROMA TERMINI** to a connecting train to **ROMA TRASTEVERE**.  You can also take a taxi, UberBLACK, or take the **H** bus.  Google Maps usually has accurate directions.

### Conference Location

GeoNode Summit 2016 is planned to be held in the Headquarters of WFP in Rome and the Holiday Inn Rome. The agenda is still under development.  We will update this page as new information is available and the agenda is confirmed.

**WFP**

The World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters is half-way from the city center to Fiumicino airport (FCO).  The address is:

```
World Food Programme
Via Cesare Giulio Viola, 68
00148 Roma
```

**Holiday Inn Rome**

Holiday Inn Rome is half-way from the city center to Fiumicino airport (FCO).  The address is:

```
Holiday Inn Rome - Eur Parco Dei Medici
Viale Castello della Magliana, 65
00148 Roma
```

The most convenient and cost-effective way to reach WFP and Holiday Inn is via train; however, **Taxi** or **UberBLACK** are both options.  **UberX** is not available in Rome.  In the morning, trains run every **15 minutes**.  Take the train to **MURATELLA** station.  If you are catching the train at **ROMA TRASTEVERE** station, the train should arrive on Platform 5 ("Binario 5" in Italian).  If you are catching the train at **ROMA OSTIENSE**, the train should arrive at platform 12.  Once you get off the train at **MURATELLA**, then exit toward the business park.  Walk to the right along the street parallel to the train tracks.  You should see a pathway to WFP (with a sign) that will take you to WFP.

You'll find all the locations in the map below.

### Entrance, Security, etc.

Normal security procedures will be followed at the World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters.  If you do not register by **November 13, 2016**, we cannot guarantee entrance into the conference sites.  We will contact registered attendees and provide instructions on how to submit the necessary information to gain entrance.  When on site at WFP, your visitor pass must be visible at all times.

### Other Notes

**Google Maps:** You can download Google Maps offline.  Google directions for public transportation work most of the time.

**UrbanRail.net:** A great site for a map of the metro system.  However, it is missing the tram locations.

**Train Timetable Italy:** A very useful Android App for realtime train locations and for purchasing tickets.  Be advised, data is sometimes delayed, but it's very useful to know when a train is cancelled, delayed, etc.
