Workshop leads help attendees 1 on 1 with initial setup of their machines.  For example, installing as needed:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)

Also, downloading vagrant boxes, as that can take a while.
