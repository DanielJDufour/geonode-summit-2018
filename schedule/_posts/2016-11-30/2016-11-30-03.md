The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery ([GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) at the World Bank supports the development of GeoNode and its use through the Open Data for Resilience Initiative ([OpenDRI](https://opendri.org/)). GeoNode is implemented in several OpenDRI projects to enable governments with an efficient and sustainable way of managing and sharing disaster risk data. This presentation reviews how those investments in GeoNode development have contributed to building open data communities and local partner capacity.
