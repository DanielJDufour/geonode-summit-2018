[GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/) has supported the [GFDRR Innovation Lab](https://www.gfdrr.org/innovation-lab) since mid 2015 on three main aspects:
* Core Development and support on GeoNode.
* Deployments of GeoNode.
* Provisioning of GeoNode training within developing countries.

In this presentation we will cover the GeoNode developments we have performed as well as those which are planned: we will make use of and refer to technical designs and architectural improvements adopted in GeoNode, as well as to the related GeoNode Improvement Proposals (GNIPs) which provide an instrument to gather community feedback and build awareness.

Developments that have been performed and/or are planned on GeoNode outside the support activities to GFDRR will also be covered.

* [GNIP: Handling raster mosaics](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2211); as part of the [C-READ](http://c-read.net/) work. GeoServer supports mosaics with custom dimensions, but there is no way to configure them on GeoNode. It is proposed to add new (optional) functionalities to provide handling of mosaics.
* [Update GeoServer version to 2.9.x](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2546); alignment of the GeoServer extension for GeoNode and the GeoNode code-base to version 2.9.x of GeoServer.
* [GNIP: GeoNode Windows Installer](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2375); a self contained installer package for Windows servers, which can be easily used by the administrators or end users in order to test the GeoNode functionalities and cleanup the system afterwards.
* [GNIP: GeoNode Backup and Restore](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2401); automatic GeoNode/GeoServer backup and restore procedures and management commands. Part of this work consisted also into the development of a "Spring-Batch" Backup&Restore module for GeoServer.
* [GNIP: GeoServer A&A Improvements](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2374); funded by Boundless, for the refactoring of the security integration between GeoServer and GeoNode reusing, where possible, available GeoServer capabilities either via the core version or via existing plugins or creating extensions that would live in the GeoServer codebase where needed. Part of this work consisted also into allowing GeoServer to Authenticate through the OAuth2 Protocol and to have GeoNode act as an OAUTH2 provider.
* [GNIP: Better management of "View" and "Download" permissions](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2696); as part of the "A&A Improvements" GNIP, this GNIP aims to improve the management of "View" and "Download" layers permissions by separating concerns between backend mapping services (OGC “WMS-like” services) and raw-data stream services (OGC “W[F,C]S-like” services).
* [GNIP: GeoNode Metadata Editor Improvements](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/issues/2408); the new GeoNode Metadata Editing Form should be more user-friendly, for instance by driving users to edit mandatory metadata, and helping them to easily spot the missing parts.
* GeoNode Notification Refactoring; the purpose of this proposal is to improve the GeoNode notifications system in order to allow GeoNode to collect notifications about resource modifications and to disseminate them asynchronously.
* GeoNode Monitoring Tools; introduce Logging, Monitoring, Alerting and Analytics DevOps tools for a better control of the GeoNode Platform and its components.
* Afghanistan  Disaster Risk Management GeoNode (http://disasterrisk.af.geonode.org/) which was developed by ENEA to host and share risk data over Afghanistan. New capabilities are being discussed: one module would allow users to dynamically explore the potential costs and benefits of the pre-calculated risk management options, by sliding bars, changing numbers and getting outputs in graphs, charts and maps. The second module would allow users to easily extract maps and tabular results for indicators of interest, using drop-down menus and boxes that filter existing information and maps.
* [MapStore 2](http://dev.mapstore2.geo-solutions.it) integration, to use a modern React-Based mapping component within GeoNode.
