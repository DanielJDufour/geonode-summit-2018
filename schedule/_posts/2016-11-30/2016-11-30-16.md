[CartoView](http://cartologic.com/cartoview) is a GeoNode project.

CartoView extends GeoNode to provide the ability to create, share, and visualize GIS Web Mapping Applications very easily and very quickly from the browser without programming.

Cartoview enables communities of users to share geospatial applications, to collaborate on these applications, and to exchange the underlying data as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web services

CartoView is developed and maintained by [CartoLogic](http://cartologic.com/).
