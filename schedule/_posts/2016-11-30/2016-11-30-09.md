**Harvard Worldmap Status Report 2016**

[WorldMap](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/), launched in 2011, is a web platform for creating, displaying, analyzing, and searching spatial data and other data forms across multiple disciplines.

WorldMap is a collaboratively edited, multilingual, free internet mapping electronic media site open to everyone that is housed at the [Center for Geographic Analysis](http://gis.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University and accessible at the WorldMap website makes it possible for those who are not experts in GIS and web mapping to explore, visualize, and share their research materials in a GIS spatial framework, enhancing their ability to conduct academic research, community service projects, and instructional activities. The WorldMap site allows users to add their own map layers and data sets, symbolize them, edit them, add overlays, add multimedia content (images, video, text), control access, and share or publish them.

WorldMap is based on a fork of the GeoNode platform. It is probably the largest GeoNode instance, with its 23k+ layers and 19k+ users. This talk will explore how GeoNode was scaled to improve the increased users demand, which new applications were developed on top of the GeoNode engine, and the plans for the future to sync with the mainstream project.
