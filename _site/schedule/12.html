<p>The <a href="https://www.globalquakemodel.org/gem/">GEM Foundation</a> (Global Earthquake Model) uses <a href="http://geonode.org/">GeoNode</a> as the core of the <a href="https://www.globalquakemodel.org/openquake/about/platform/">OpenQuake platform</a>, a collaborative web environment to share tools, documents, data, and scientific results.</p>

<p>This approach allowed us to reach our initial goals, however we encountered frequent regressions during development of new features, and found that our code-base also presented difficulties when attempting to migrate to newer versions of GeoNode.</p>

<p>In this presentation we describe the Test Framework that we developed to mitigate regressions, the tools and methodologies we have applied and our future plans to improve our software architecture and facilitate migration.</p>

<p>GEM is a non-profit foundation with a mission to produce models of earthquakes and their consequences, and open-source software and data to advance the science of seismic risk assessment.</p>

<p>GEM collaborates with experts around the world to create global datasets, regional models of seismic risk and tools to collect data, construct models and calculate risk.</p>

<p>Some example users include: scientists, engineers, risk analysts, students, emergency managers, policy makers.</p>
