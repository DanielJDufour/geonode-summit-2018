<p>GeoNode relies on <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> by default for some of its core functionalities related to serving geospatial data.
This presentation will provide an introduction to the GeoServer project and its abilities to publish data with a mix of well known OGC protocols and other popular protocol and data formats, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting up vector and raster data from the GeoServer administration control</li>
  <li>Styling layers using desktop tools, with a carousel of GeoServer mapping abilities</li>
  <li>Tile caching with WMTS</li>
</ul>

<p>but it will also go beyond that, introducing advanced capabilities like</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data processing with WPS</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Spatiotemporal data handling</li>
</ul>
